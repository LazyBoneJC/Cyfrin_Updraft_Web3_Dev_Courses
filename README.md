# My Journey Through Cyfrin Updraft's Web3 Courses üöÄ

Welcome to my Web3 Development Learning Repository! This space documents my journey and progress through the comprehensive [Cyfrin Updraft Web3 Dev Courses](https://cyfrin.io/). Here, you will find a collection of my notes, code implementations, and hands-on projects, reflecting my dedication to mastering the world of decentralized applications.

## üéØ My Goals

My primary objective with this course and repository is to:

-   Master the foundational and advanced concepts of Web3 and blockchain development.
-   Gain deep proficiency in **Solidity**, smart contract engineering, and security best practices.
-   Build practical, secure, and scalable dApps (Decentralized Applications) using cutting-edge tools and frameworks like Foundry.
-   Showcase my skills and passion for building the future of the decentralized web.

## üìö What I've Learned

This repository is organized by the courses I've completed, each folder containing relevant projects, tests, and scripts.

### 1. Solidity Smart Contract Development

This section covers the fundamentals of blockchain development and the core concepts of the Solidity programming language.

-   **Key Concepts Covered**: Blockchain developer fundamentals, Smart Contract ABI, Solidity data types, functions, mappings, structs, custom errors, and SafeMath principles.
-   **Advanced Topics**: Solidity inheritance, gas optimization techniques, and the complete Ethereum developer workflow.
-   **Projects**: `SimpleStorage`, `StorageFactory`, and a full `FundMe` contract that interacts with Chainlink Price Feeds.

### 2. Foundry Fundamentals

This course provided a deep dive into Foundry, the blazing-fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development.

-   **Key Tools Mastered**: Foundryup, Forge, and Anvil for a complete local development and testing environment.
-   **Core Skills**: Writing and running comprehensive smart contract tests (unit, integration, and fork tests), creating local testnets, and verifying smart contracts on-chain.
-   **Projects**:
    -   `foundry_simple_storage`: A basic contract to learn the fundamentals of Foundry testing.
    -   `foundry_fund_me`: A more complex contract that uses Chainlink Oracles, with a full suite of tests.
    -   `foundry_smart_contract_lottery`: A provably random lottery smart contract using Chainlink VRF.
    -   `html_fund_me`: A simple frontend to interact with the `FundMe` contract, demonstrating dApp connectivity with `ethers.js`.

### 3. Advanced Foundry

Building on the fundamentals, this course explored advanced smart contract development patterns and testing methodologies.

-   **Key Concepts**: Advanced smart contract design patterns for DeFi, DAOs, and Stablecoins.
-   **Advanced Testing**: In-depth fuzz testing, manual verification techniques, and advanced testing strategies with Foundry.
-   **Projects**:
    -   `foundry_erc20`: Development and testing of a standard ERC20 token.
    -   `foundry_nft`: Creation of various NFT types, including a dynamic SVG NFT that changes based on on-chain data.
